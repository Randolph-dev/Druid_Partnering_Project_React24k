2. Assign yourself to a ticket
3. Click on the ticket
4. Create a branch using Jira **BRANCHING FROM DEV, NOT MAIN** and copy the branch name
5. Pull the branch `git pull origin BRANCH_NAME`
6. Checkout the branch `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`
7. Commit your changes `git commit -m "SCRUM-xx <message>"`

### To access live site
- Drupal: Hosted with Pantheon [https://dev-druid-partnering-project-react24k.pantheonsite.io/](https://dev-druid-partnering-project-react24k.pantheonsite.io/)
- React: Hosted with Netlify [https://druid-project.alextran.dev](https://druid-project.alextran.dev)
- Mautic: Deployed a dockerized version in private server [https://mautic.alextran.cloud/](https://mautic.alextran.cloud/)

### Mautic
- Mautic used to be a folder living in this repo but because it is too heavy and require setting up on all local machine,
it is now installed online
- Here is the link to Mautic dashboard: [https://mautic.alextran.cloud/](https://mautic.alextran.cloud/)
- Remember to set the Mautic link as environment variable for it to track properly
- Ask or check the message channel for the login credential

### Possible issues during Mautic set up (outdated with the latest update)
Some issues may appear during Mautic's installation process. Most of which are caused by the composer install. Some of them can be:
- Memory exhaustion issue with PHP - allowed PHP memory space isn't enough to handle the operations required for the install. Solution: increase memory limit with ```php -d memory_limit=-1 bin/ ```
- Composer extension errors - failure to install in the working repository. Solution: Ran composer with ignore commands to keep the install process while ignoring the problematic extensions ```composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-imap --ignore-platform-req=ext-redis```
- Security issues - Some files can be interrupted during the install due to dubios origin/authors. This can be solved by whitelisting the files.
- If you encounter issues such as too many files being commited, this is possibly caused by .gitignore failing to properly ignore the specified content. Run ```git rm -r --cached .``` (or to force) ```git rm -r --cached . -f``` to clear tracking of all files and re-add only the files specified for tracking based on .gitignore settings.
